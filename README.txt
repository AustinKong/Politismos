Project "Politismos": Trading game demo
A trading game demo made in Jun - July 2022.

Islands are generated with perlin noise and gradient maps.
Heavily inspired by Hachinos (tiny cactus studio)'s artstyle. https://twitter.com/hachinos_
This is just a demo, all art and code made by Austin Kong.

Controls:
-Mouse button to interact with buildings and trees
-Click and drag on the cart to move around
-Toggle speed to make things faster
-Press randomize island button if you are stuck

Possible actions:
-Cut down forests (for a price)
-Buy a new cart from the harbor
-Buy and sell goods between buildings and ships at the harbor

People will get displeased if you neglect them for long periods of time, try to trade with everybody periodically.
Making the people displeased for too long will lead to a game over.
Currently there is no win condition, try to earn as much gold as you can. Have fun!

Authors notes:
-No point reading through/trying to rip off my code, it's spaghetti as hell
-As this is only an early demo, the harbor might sometimes be unattached to the main island, in that case, just restart the level as it is unplayable
